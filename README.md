2. Add these files to your repository:
   - `index.js` (the main bot file)
   - `package.json` (with required dependencies)
   - `render.yaml` (deployment configuration)


### Step 2: Required Environment Variables

2. Encode it in Base64:
   ```bash
   base64 -i serviceAccount.json > encoded.txt
   ```
3. Use the content of `encoded.txt` as `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` value

### Step 4: Deploy to Render

2. Select the repository containing your bot code
3. Render will automatically detect `render.yaml`
4. Confirm deployment
